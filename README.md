This is an application developed in Android Studio for the game Legends of Runeterra. The app serves as a mini-encyclopedia (wiki) and provides tools for managing and organizing decks in the game.

IMPORTANT: The app doesn't work right after being downloaded because Riot Games' API expires every 24 hours unless a permanent version is obtained.
